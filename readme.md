## Node.js Meme Scraper

Creates a cli (Command Line Interface) application that scrapes this website:

memegen-link-examples-upleveled.netlify.app

...and saves the first 10 images into a folder called "memes" within the directory of the new project. The image files should be named with a number with a leading zero, eg. 01.jpg, 02.jpg, etc.
